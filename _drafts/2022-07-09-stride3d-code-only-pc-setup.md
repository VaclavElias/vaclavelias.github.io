You can programm in C# and you are now curious about game engines or any way how to code and present something in 3D. There are some C# options out there ([Unity](https://unity.com/), ..) but there is one in particular which might impress you if you found game engines overwhelming or you don't want to install too many things. 

[Stride](https://www.stride3d.net) is a **free and open source 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine** ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stride_(game_engine))). With the release of version 4.1 you can start playing and be creative just with a few lines of code and without installation of the game engine editor.

*Note: You do need to install certain prerequisites (Visual C++ Redistributable) and anything else comes from NuGet packages.*

## Why code only approach and not game editor?

- You don't want to install anything on your computer (no Stride installation required)
- You want to start very quickly
- You want to learn C# programming with a nice visual 2D/3D output instead of console
- You want to learn game programming gradually, in the simplest way, without using the game editor
- You find coding and coding tools very complex to understand and navigate around
- You want to start with game development basics before you even start exploring the game editor
- Easy and quick prototyping
- Easy to learn game development concepts and steps
- Performance and feature evaluation
