## Introduction üå±

Welcome to the preview of the [Stride Community Toolkit](https://stride3d.github.io/stride-community-toolkit/index.html), a collection of extensions and helpers for the [Stride 3D](https://www.stride3d.net/) C# game engine. This community-driven, [open-source project](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-community-toolkit) is designed to assist developers in creating 2D/3D games and visualizations using [Stride](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/index.html).

Although the toolkit is still in its early stages, it already offers several valuable features. In this post, I will focus on the [code-only](https://stride3d.github.io/stride-community-toolkit/manual/code-only/index.html) approach, which I found particularly useful for development.

This article assumes that you have some experience with .NET and C# programming.

The toolkit allows you to create a game using a code-only approach, meaning you can develop a game without relying on the Stride [Game Studio](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/game-studio/index.html). As a C#/.NET developer in my day job, I found this approach very helpful for getting started with the Stride 3D engine and game development, bypassing the need to work directly in the Game Studio.

Additional details on the benefits of the code-only approach can be found [here](https://stride3d.github.io/stride-community-toolkit/manual/code-only/index.html) in the toolkit documentation.

We will be using a standard .NET 8 **Console App** to create a simple game by adding some NuGet packages to get started.

Here‚Äôs the process I found to be the easiest way to begin with the code-only approach:

1. Run the minimal code to get the game window running
2. Add entities/primitives to the scene
3. Add interaction with the keyboard and mouse
4. Add output to the console or screen

### Code-Only on Windows ü™ü

The code-only approach is currently available only on Windows. The toolkit provides a set of NuGet packages that you can use to create a game without the need for the Game Studio.

### Code-Only on Other Platforms üêß 

This option is not yet available but is planned for the future ([Use CompilerApp cross-platform binary instead of exe](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/pull/2279)). While Stride is a cross-platform engine, you can build the game on Windows and then run it on other platforms. However, one of the build tools, `Stride.Core.Assets.CompilerApp.exe`, which is responsible for building the assets, is currently only available on Windows.

## Prerequisites üè† 

These prerequisites were tested on a clean Windows 11 installation.

1. Install the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) (25MB) and restart your system if prompted.
2. Install the [.NET 8 SDK x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) (200MB).
3. Install the IDE of your choice. I will be using [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), but you can also use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), Rider, or any other IDE that supports .NET development.

## The Story of the Brave Explorers üìò

üåç Welcome, brave explorers of the digital wilderness! Today, we embark on an exciting journey into the heart of the Stride 3D game engine. Our guide? None other than the Stride Community Toolkit.

In the vast expanse of the coding universe, we'll create a new world from nothing but a .NET 8 Console App. Prepare to witness the birth of a game window, a black void of nothingness that will soon teem with life ü´é.

As we venture further, we'll bring light into our world, transforming the empty void into a vibrant blue expanse. But what's a world without inhabitants? We'll conjure a 3D capsule, our first digital lifeform, into existence.

Beware, fellow adventurers! Our capsule is a wild creature, prone to falling into the void. But fear not, for we'll harness the power of a 3D camera üé• controller to keep a watchful eye üëÅÔ∏è on our creation.

So, refresh your mouse agility skills üñ±Ô∏è, and join us on this exhilarating expedition. Let's dive into the code! üíª

## Step 1: Create a New C# .NET 8 Console App - Nothingness ‚ö´

1. Create a new C# .NET 8 Console App in your IDE.
1. Add the following NuGet package: üì¶
    ```bash
    dotnet add package Stride.CommunityToolkit.Windows --prerelease
    ```
1. Paste the following code into your `Program.cs` file: üíª
    ```csharp
    using Stride.Engine;

    // Create an instance of the game
    using var game = new Game();

    // Start the game loop
    game.Run();
    ```
1. The first build on your computer requires running the command below. Afterward, you can just use your IDE to build:
    ```bash
    dotnet build --runtime win-x64
    ``` 
1. Run the application.
1. Behold the black void of nothingness üôÄ.

{% include _alert-svg.html %}
{% include _alert.html type:'info' title:'The NuGet package <code>Stride.CommunityToolkit.Windows</code> is used specifically for code-only projects. You should use the <code>Stride.CommunityToolkit</code> NuGet package when referencing from a regular Stride project generated from the Game Studio.' %}

## Step 2: Let There Be Light - Or at Least Blue üåå

Once upon a time in a galaxy far, far away, you should see a window with a black background. This is the Stride 3D game window. üñ•Ô∏è As a black screen is not very exciting, let's add some mystery code to make it more interesting. This time, we use the `Stride.CommunityToolkit.Engine` namespace so we can reference some of the toolkit helper methods. üîß‚ú®


```csharp
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Engine;  // This was added: Import the toolkit's helper methods
using Stride.Engine;

// Create an instance of the game
using var game = new Game();

// Start the game loop and provide the Start method as a callback
game.Run(start: Start);  // This was updated

// This was added
// Define the Start method to set up the scene
void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    // Add the default graphics compositor to handle rendering
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();

    // Add a 3D camera to the scene to allow viewing from different angles
    game.Add3DCamera();
}
```
The code above does the following:

- `Start()` method is a callback that is invoked when the game starts. It takes a `Scene` object as a parameter, representing the root scene of the game.
- `AddGraphicsCompositor()` organizes [how scenes are rendered](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/graphics/graphics-compositor/index.html) in the Stride engine, enabling extensive customization of the rendering pipeline.
- `Add3DCamera()` adds a 3D camera to the scene, allowing you to view it from various angles.

Run the application again. Now, instead of a black screen, you should see a blue screen. üåå While not overly exciting, it‚Äôs a step in the right direction. We‚Äôre looking through the camera, but there‚Äôs nothing to see‚Äîyet. üëÄ

## Step 3: Add Some Shapes - Capsule Time! üé®

Let's add something to the scene. üé® This time, we will be utilizing the `Stride.CommunityToolkit.Rendering.ProceduralModels` namespace, which provides helper methods for generating procedural models like capsules, cubes, and spheres. We will add a capsule to the scene.

```csharp
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Engine;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Rendering.ProceduralModels;  // This was added: Import procedural model helpers
using Stride.Engine;

// Create an instance of the game
using var game = new Game();

// Start the game loop and provide the Start method as a callback
game.Run(start: Start);

// Define the Start method to set up the scene
void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    // Add the default graphics compositor to handle rendering
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();

    // Add a 3D camera to the scene to allow viewing from different angles
    game.Add3DCamera();

    // Create a 3D primitive capsule and store it in an entity
    var entity = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Capsule); // This was added
}
```

In this step, we added a new line that creates a 3D primitive capsule. üßä The `Create3DPrimitive()` method takes a `PrimitiveModelType` enum as a parameter and returns an [`Entity`](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/game-studio/add-entities.html) object. The `PrimitiveModelType` enum defines the types of primitive 3D models that can be generated, such as capsules, cubes, and spheres.

Run the application again. Surprise, nothing happened! üò≤ We created an entity, but we didn't add it to the scene. This is a typical beginner's mistake ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. To fix it, update the `Start` method to look like this:

```csharp
// Define the Start method to set up the scene
void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    // Add the default graphics compositor to handle rendering
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();

    // Add a 3D camera to the scene to allow viewing from different angles
    game.Add3DCamera();

    // Create a 3D primitive capsule and store it in an entity
    var entity = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Capsule);

    // Add the entity to the root scene so it becomes part of the scene graph
    entity.Scene = rootScene; // This was added
}
```

Now, run the application again. You should see a capsule in the middle of the screen if you're lucky because it's falling down. Fast! üöÄ

## Step 4: Control the Camera - Look Around! üñ±Ô∏è

Maybe we should at least look around the scene and view the capsule from different angles as it falls into the void üò†?

Let's add a 3D camera controller using the `Add3DCameraController()` method. üéÆ This extension adds basic camera functionality, allowing you to interact with the camera through keyboard and mouse inputs. Specifically, it attaches a regular `SyncScript` to the camera with custom logic to handle camera movement. Time to refresh those mouse agility skills!

```csharp
// This was updated: Add a camera controller for basic camera movement
game.Add3DCamera().Add3DCameraController();
```

Run the application again and use right-click and hold to rotate the camera towards the capsule, or follow the instructions displayed on the screen. üé• Feeling a bit more satisfied now? Let's make the experience even more interesting! üé®‚ú®

## Step 5: Reposition the Capsule - More Excitement! üìç

Let's reposition the capsule to add a bit more excitement and give us a few extra seconds to admire it before it falls. Update the `Start` method as shown below, and don't forget to add the `Stride.Core.Mathematics` namespace for handling the 3D positioning.

```csharp
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Engine;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Rendering.ProceduralModels;
using Stride.Core.Mathematics;  // This was added: Import Vector3 and other math utilities
using Stride.Engine;

// Create an instance of the game
using var game = new Game();

// Start the game loop and provide the Start method as a callback
game.Run(start: Start);

// Define the Start method to set up the scene
void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    // Add the default graphics compositor to handle rendering
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();

    // Add a 3D camera and a controller for basic camera movement
    game.Add3DCamera().Add3DCameraController();

    // Create a 3D primitive capsule and store it in an entity
    var entity = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Capsule);

    // Reposition the capsule 8 units above the origin in the scene
    entity.Transform.Position = new Vector3(0, 8, 0); // This was added

    // Add the entity to the root scene so it becomes part of the scene graph
    entity.Scene = rootScene;
}
```
- `entity.Transform.Position` sets the position of the entity within the scene. The `Vector3` object represents a 3D vector, which in this case, places the capsule at coordinates `(0, 8, 0)`, which is 8 units above the scene's origin.
- `Stride.Core.Mathematics` Stride uses its own implementation of `Vector3` and other math utilities, so we need to add this namespace to access those features.

Run the application again. You should see a capsule falling down from the top of the screen. I know, the capsule is black, but don't worry, we'll fix that later. üòâ

## Step 6: Add a Ground - Catch the Capsule! üõë

Now let's catch the capsule by adding some ground to the scene. Update the `Start` method to look like this:

```csharp
// Define the Start method to set up the scene
void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    // Add the default graphics compositor to handle rendering
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();

    // Add a 3D camera and a controller for basic camera movement
    game.Add3DCamera().Add3DCameraController();

    // Add a 3D ground plane to catch the capsule
    game.Add3DGround(); // This was added

    // Create a 3D primitive capsule and store it in an entity
    var entity = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Capsule);

    // Reposition the capsule 8 units above the origin in the scene
    entity.Transform.Position = new Vector3(0, 8, 0);

    // Add the entity to the root scene so it becomes part of the scene graph
    entity.Scene = rootScene;
}
```

- `Add3DGround()` is a toolkit helper method that creates a 3D ground plane in the scene, providing a surface for the capsule to land on.

Run the application again. You should see the capsule falling down and landing on the ground. üéâ Unfortunately, it's still a black capsule on a black ground ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. But don't worry, we‚Äôll fix that later! In the meantime, you can move the camera around using the mouse and keyboard (Q or E) to lower or raise the camera and watch the capsule roll around on the ground. üñ±Ô∏è‚å®Ô∏è

## Step 7: Illuminate the Scene - Add Light! üí°

It's time to brighten things up! Adding some light to the scene will help us see our objects more clearly. Thankfully, there's a helper method called `game.AddDirectionalLight()` that adds a directional light to the scene. Update the `Start` method to look like this:

```csharp
// Define the Start method to set up the scene
void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    // Add the default graphics compositor to handle rendering
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();

    // Add a 3D camera and a controller for basic camera movement
    game.Add3DCamera().Add3DCameraController();

    // Add a directional light to illuminate the scene
    game.AddDirectionalLight(); // This was added

    // Add a 3D ground plane to catch the capsule
    game.Add3DGround();

    // Create a 3D primitive capsule and store it in an entity
    var entity = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Capsule);

    // Reposition the capsule 8 units above the origin in the scene
    entity.Transform.Position = new Vector3(0, 8, 0);

    // Add the entity to the root scene so it becomes part of the scene graph
    entity.Scene = rootScene;
}
```

Run the application again. üåü You should now see the capsule falling down and landing on the ground, with everything clearly illuminated by the directional light. The capsule and ground are much easier to see, thanks to the added light shining on the scene. üéâ

Finally, no more black-on-black mysteries! üí°

## Step 8: Break 1 - Let's Reflect üòÖ

Tedious work but great job, explorer! üéâ You‚Äôve just learned the very basics of game setup behind the scenes‚Äîwork that‚Äôs usually done for you automatically in the Game Studio. Let‚Äôs take a moment to reflect on what we've built so far:

- You need a [Graphics Compositor](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/graphics/graphics-compositor/index.html) to render the scene.
- You need a [Camera](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/graphics/cameras/index.html) to view the scene from different angles.
- You need a Camera Controller, a [C# script](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/scripts/index.html), to move the camera around and navigate the scene.
- You need a [Light](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/graphics/lights-and-shadows/index.html) to illuminate the scene and bring everything into focus

Once these basics are set up, you can start adding entities to the scene. In our example, we‚Äôve added:

- A 3D Ground, a simple primitive model that provides a surface.
- A Capsule, another primitive model, which we‚Äôve repositioned and dropped into the scene.

The toolkit automatically added [colliders](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/physics/colliders.html) for the ground and capsule, ensuring that the capsule doesn't fall through the ground but instead interacts realistically with the scene.

Whew! üòÖ Take a deep breath, and get ready for the next part of our journey. Up next: performance optimizations and more interactive elements. üöÄ

## Step 9: Add Profiler - Performance! üìà

We love FPS = lot and we want to see it. The toolkit provides a `game.AddProfiler()` method that adds a performance profiler to the game. Update the `Start` method to look like this:

```csharp
void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();
    game.Add3DCamera().Add3DCameraController();
    game.AddDirectionalLight();
    game.Add3DGround();

    game.AddProfiler(); // This was added

    var entity = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Capsule);
    entity.Transform.Position = new Vector3(0, 8, 0);
    entity.Scene = rootScene;
}
```

Run the application again. You should see a [profiler text output](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/troubleshooting/profiling.html) in the top-left corner of the screen showing the frames per second (FPS) and other performance metrics. Press F1 to loop through profile outputs. 

## Step 10: Illuminate the Scene - Add Skybox! üåá

As much as I am already excited how things are looking, we can make our scene looking better. Let's add a skybox to the scene. The toolkit provides a `AddSkybox()` method that adds a skybox to the scene. Firstly, we need to add another NuGet package `Stride.CommunityToolkit.Skyboxes` which brings also some assets required for the skybox.

```bash
dotnet add package Stride.CommunityToolkit.Skyboxes --prerelease
```

Then update the code to look like this:


```csharp
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Engine;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Rendering.ProceduralModels;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Skyboxes;  // This was added
using Stride.Core.Mathematics;
using Stride.Engine;

using var game = new Game();

game.Run(start: Start);

void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();
    game.Add3DCamera().Add3DCameraController();
    game.AddDirectionalLight();
    game.Add3DGround();
    game.AddProfiler();

    game.AddSkybox(); // This was added

    var entity = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Capsule);
    entity.Transform.Position = new Vector3(0, 8, 0);
    entity.Scene = rootScene;
}
```

Run the application again. You should see a skybox in the scene, making it look more realistic. The [skybox](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/graphics/textures/skyboxes-and-backgrounds.html) is a 3D model that surrounds the scene and provides a background for the scene.

## Step 11: Add Motion - Move the Cube! üì¶ 

Let's add a box to the scene. But before we start coding, let's consider the different ways we can move the box:

1. **Moving Entities by Changing Their Position Directly (Without Colliders)**
   - Simple movement without interaction with other entities.
   - Non-physical movement that doesn't involve realistic physics or collisions.
2. **Moving Entities Using Physics (With Colliders)**
   - Realistic movement that interacts with the environment.
   - Interaction with other entities, including collisions.
   - Movement influenced by gravity and other forces.
   - Physics-driven game mechanics.
   - Environmental interaction, like bouncing, sliding, or responding to obstacles.

### Moving Entity Without Colliders
      
For this step, we'll start with the first option: moving the box by directly changing its position. Update the code to look like this:


```csharp
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Engine;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Rendering.ProceduralModels;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Skyboxes;
using Stride.Core.Mathematics;
using Stride.Engine;
using Stride.Games;  // This was added

float movementSpeed = 1f; // This was added
Entity? cube1 = null; // This was added

using var game = new Game();

game.Run(start: Start, update: Update); // This was updated

void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();
    game.Add3DCamera().Add3DCameraController();
    game.AddDirectionalLight();
    game.Add3DGround();
    game.AddProfiler();
    game.AddSkybox();

    // This was added to see the axis directions
    game.AddGroundGizmo(position: new Vector3(-5, 0.1f, -5), showAxisName: true);

    var entity = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Capsule);
    entity.Transform.Position = new Vector3(0, 8, 0);
    entity.Scene = rootScene;

    // This was added
    // Note that we are disabling the collider for the box and
    // adding a material to it so that we can change the color of the box
    // The box is hanging in the default position Vector(0,0,0) in the air,
    // so it won't collide with the ground
    cube1 = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Cube, new()
    {
        Material = game.CreateMaterial(Color.Gold),
        IncludeCollider = false
    });
    cube1.Scene = rootScene;
}

// This was added
// This method is called every frame to update the game state. It takes two parameters:
// scene: The current scene being rendered.
// time: An object representing the elapsed game time.
void Update(Scene scene, GameTime time)
{
    // Calculates the time elapsed since the last frame in seconds.
    // This is crucial for frame-independent movement, ensuring consistent
    // behaviour regardless of frame rate.
    var deltaTime = (float)time.Elapsed.TotalSeconds;

    if (cube1 != null)
    {
        //Moves cube1 along the negative X-axis. The movement is scaled by movementSpeed
        //and deltaTime to ensure smooth and consistent motion.
        cube1.Transform.Position -= new Vector3(movementSpeed * deltaTime, 0, 0);
    }
}

```

- `movementSpeed` is a constant that determines how fast the box moves.
- `cube1` is an `Entity` object that represents the box in the scene.
- `AddGroundGizmo()` adds a ground gizmo to the scene. The ground gizmo is a visual representation of the ground plane that shows the axis directions.
- `CreateMaterial()` creates a new material with the specified color. You can color also the capsule if you wish üòâ.
- `Update()` is a callback that is called every frame. It takes a `Scene` object and a `GameTime` object as parameters.
- The `GameTime` object contains information about the time elapsed since the last frame.
- `deltaTime` is the time elapsed since the last frame in seconds.

Run the application. You should see a box moving in X direction.

### Moving Entity With Colliders

```csharp
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Engine;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Rendering.ProceduralModels;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Skyboxes;
using Stride.Core.Mathematics;
using Stride.Engine;
using Stride.Games;
using Stride.Physics;

float movementSpeed = 1f;
Entity? cube1 = null;
Entity? cube2 = null; // This was added
float force = 3f; // This was added

using var game = new Game();

game.Run(start: Start, update: Update);

void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();
    game.Add3DCamera().Add3DCameraController();
    game.AddDirectionalLight();
    game.Add3DGround();
    game.AddProfiler();
    game.AddSkybox();

    game.AddGroundGizmo(position: new Vector3(-5, 0.1f, -5), showAxisName: true);

    var entity = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Capsule);
    entity.Transform.Position = new Vector3(0, 8, 0);
    entity.Scene = rootScene;

    cube1 = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Cube, new()
    {
        Material = game.CreateMaterial(Color.Gold),
        IncludeCollider = false
    });
    cube1.Scene = rootScene;

    // This was added
    // Collider is included be default in this extension
    cube2 = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Cube, new()
    {
        Material = game.CreateMaterial(Color.Orange)
    });
    cube2.Transform.Position = new Vector3(-3, 5, 0);
    cube2.Scene = rootScene;
}

void Update(Scene scene, GameTime time)
{
    // Calculates the time elapsed since the last frame in seconds.
    // This is crucial for frame-independent movement, ensuring consistent
    // behaviour regardless of frame rate.
    var deltaTime = (float)time.Elapsed.TotalSeconds;

    if (cube1 != null)
    {
        //Moves cube1 along the negative X-axis. The movement is scaled by movementSpeed
        //and deltaTime to ensure smooth and consistent motion.
        cube1.Transform.Position -= new Vector3(movementSpeed * deltaTime, 0, 0);
    }

    // This was added
    if (cube2 != null)
    {
        // Retrieve the RigidbodyComponent from cube2, which handles physics-based interactions.
        var rigidBody = cube2.Get<RigidbodyComponent>();

        // Check if cube2 is stationary by verifying if its linear velocity is effectively zero.
        if (Math.Round(rigidBody.LinearVelocity.Length()) == 0)
        {
            // Apply an impulse to cube2 along the X-axis, initiating movement.
            rigidBody.ApplyImpulse(new Vector3(force, 0, 0));

            // Reverse the direction of the impulse for the next application,
            // allowing cube2 to move back and forth along the X-axis.
            force *= -1;
        }
    }
}

```

## Step 12: Add Keyboard Interaction - Move the Cube! ‚å®Ô∏è

We will use the `Update` method to move the box around using the keyboard. Update the `Update` method to look like this, also make sure that `Stride.Input;` namespace was added:


```csharp
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Engine;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Rendering.ProceduralModels;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Skyboxes;
using Stride.Core.Mathematics;
using Stride.Engine;
using Stride.Games;
using Stride.Input;
using Stride.Physics;

float movementSpeed = 5f;
Entity? box1 = null;
Entity? box2 = null;
RigidbodyComponent? rigidBody = null;

using var game = new Game();

game.Run(start: Start, update: Update);

void Start(Scene rootScene)

- `game.Input.IsKeyDown()` checks if a key is pressed. It takes a `Keys` enum value as a parameter.

Run the application. You should see the box moving in the X direction only, left and right when you press the Z and X keys, respectively. Note that the capsule is not colliding with the box because we disabled the collider for the box.
