## Introduction üå±

Welcome to the preview of the [Stride Community Toolkit](https://stride3d.github.io/stride-community-toolkit/index.html), a collection of extensions and helpers for the [Stride 3D](https://www.stride3d.net/) C# game engine. This community-driven, [open-source project](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-community-toolkit) is designed to assist developers in creating 2D/3D games and visualizations using [Stride](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/index.html).

Although the toolkit is still in its early stages, it already offers several valuable features. In this post, I will focus on the [code-only](https://stride3d.github.io/stride-community-toolkit/manual/code-only/index.html) approach, which I found particularly useful for development.

This article assumes that you have some experience with .NET and C# programming.

The toolkit allows you to create a game using a code-only approach, meaning you can develop a game without relying on the Stride [Game Studio](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/game-studio/index.html). As a C#/.NET developer in my day job, I found this approach very helpful for getting started with the Stride 3D engine and game development, bypassing the need to work directly in the Game Studio.

Additional details on the benefits of the code-only approach can be found [here](https://stride3d.github.io/stride-community-toolkit/manual/code-only/index.html) in the toolkit documentation.

We will be using a standard .NET 8 **Console App** to create a simple game by adding some NuGet packages to get started.

Here‚Äôs the process I found to be the easiest way to begin with the code-only approach:

1. Run the minimal code to get the game window running
2. Add entities/primitives to the scene
3. Add interaction with the keyboard and mouse
4. Add output to the console or screen

### Code-Only on Windows ü™ü

The code-only approach is currently available only on Windows. The toolkit provides a set of NuGet packages that you can use to create a game without the need for the Game Studio.

### Code-Only on Other Platforms üêß 

This option is not yet available but is planned for the future ([Use CompilerApp cross-platform binary instead of exe](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/pull/2279)). While Stride is a cross-platform engine, you can build the game on Windows and then run it on other platforms. However, one of the build tools, `Stride.Core.Assets.CompilerApp.exe`, which is responsible for building the assets, is currently only available on Windows.

## What You'll Learn üéØ

By the end of this post, you will have a solid foundation in using the Stride Community Toolkit's code-only feature to create a simple game. You‚Äôll learn how to:

## The Story of the Brave Explorers üìò

üåç Welcome, brave explorers of the digital wilderness! Today, we embark on an exciting journey into the heart of the Stride 3D game engine. Our guide? None other than the Stride Community Toolkit.

In the vast expanse of the coding universe, we'll create a new world from nothing but a .NET 8 Console App. Prepare to witness the birth of a game window, a black void of nothingness that will soon teem with life ü´é.

As we venture further, we'll bring light into our world, transforming the empty void into a vibrant blue expanse. But what's a world without inhabitants? We'll conjure a 3D capsule, our first digital lifeform, into existence.

Beware, fellow adventurers! Our capsule is a wild creature, prone to falling into the void. But fear not, for we'll harness the power of a 3D camera üé• controller to keep a watchful eye üëÅÔ∏è on our creation.

So, refresh your mouse agility skills üñ±Ô∏è, and join us on this exhilarating expedition. Let's dive into the code! üíª

## Step 1: Create a New C# .NET 8 Console App - Nothingness ‚ö´

1. Create a new C# .NET 8 Console App in your IDE.
1. Add the following NuGet package: üì¶
    ```bash
    dotnet add package Stride.CommunityToolkit.Windows --prerelease
    ```
1. Paste the following code into your `Program.cs` file: üíª
    ```csharp
    using Stride.Engine;

    // Create an instance of the game
    using var game = new Game();

    // Start the game loop
    game.Run();
    ```
1. The first build on your computer requires running the command below. Afterward, you can just use your IDE to build:
    ```bash
    dotnet build --runtime win-x64
    ``` 
1. Run the application.
1. Behold the black void of nothingness üôÄ.

{% include _alert-svg.html %}
{% include _alert.html type:'info' title:'The NuGet package <code>Stride.CommunityToolkit.Windows</code> is used specifically for code-only projects. You should use the <code>Stride.CommunityToolkit</code> NuGet package when referencing from a regular Stride project generated from the Game Studio.' %}

{% include _alert.html type:'success' title: "You learnt how to setup Stride game window using the Stride Community Toolkit and even though it's just a black screen the game window is running." %}

## Step 2: Let There Be Light - Or at Least Blue üåå

Once upon a time in a galaxy far, far away, you should see a window with a black background. This is the Stride 3D game window. üñ•Ô∏è As a black screen is not very exciting, let's add some mystery code to make it more interesting. This time, we use the `Stride.CommunityToolkit.Engine` namespace so we can reference some of the toolkit helper methods. üîß‚ú®


```csharp
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Engine;  // This was added: Import the toolkit's helper methods
using Stride.Engine;

// Create an instance of the game
using var game = new Game();

// Start the game loop and provide the Start method as a callback
game.Run(start: Start);  // This was updated

// This was added
// Define the Start method to set up the scene
void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    // Add the default graphics compositor to handle rendering
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();

    // Add a 3D camera to the scene to allow viewing from different angles
    game.Add3DCamera();
}
```
The code above does the following:

- `Start()` method is a callback that is invoked when the game starts. It takes a `Scene` object as a parameter, representing the root scene of the game.
- `AddGraphicsCompositor()` organizes [how scenes are rendered](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/graphics/graphics-compositor/index.html) in the Stride engine, enabling extensive customization of the rendering pipeline.
- `Add3DCamera()` adds a 3D camera to the scene, allowing you to view it from various angles.

Run the application again. Now, instead of a black screen, you should see a blue screen. üåå While not overly exciting, it‚Äôs a step in the right direction. We‚Äôre looking through the camera, but there‚Äôs nothing to see‚Äîyet. üëÄ

{% include _alert.html type:'success' title: "You learnt that Graphics Compositor is used to handle rendering and 3D Camera is used to view the scene from different angles. Still nothing to see because we haven't added anything to the scene yet. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" %}

## Step 3: Add Some Shapes - Capsule Time! üé®

Let's add something to the scene. üé® This time, we will be utilizing the `Stride.CommunityToolkit.Rendering.ProceduralModels` namespace, which provides helper methods for generating procedural models like capsules, cubes, and spheres. We will add a capsule to the scene.

```csharp
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Engine;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Rendering.ProceduralModels;  // This was added: Import procedural model helpers
using Stride.Engine;

// Create an instance of the game
using var game = new Game();

// Start the game loop and provide the Start method as a callback
game.Run(start: Start);

// Define the Start method to set up the scene
void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    // Add the default graphics compositor to handle rendering
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();

    // Add a 3D camera to the scene to allow viewing from different angles
    game.Add3DCamera();

    // Create a 3D primitive capsule and store it in an entity
    var entity = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Capsule); // This was added
}
```

In this step, we added a new line that creates a 3D primitive capsule. üßä The `Create3DPrimitive()` method takes a `PrimitiveModelType` enum as a parameter and returns an [`Entity`](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/game-studio/add-entities.html) object. The `PrimitiveModelType` enum defines the types of primitive 3D models that can be generated, such as capsules, cubes, and spheres.

Run the application again. Surprise, nothing happened! üò≤ We created an entity, but we didn't add it to the scene. This is a typical beginner's mistake ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. To fix it, update the `Start` method to look like this:

```csharp
// Define the Start method to set up the scene
void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    // Add the default graphics compositor to handle rendering
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();

    // Add a 3D camera to the scene to allow viewing from different angles
    game.Add3DCamera();

    // Create a 3D primitive capsule and store it in an entity
    var entity = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Capsule);

    // Add the entity to the root scene so it becomes part of the scene graph
    entity.Scene = rootScene; // This was added
}
```

Now, run the application again. You should see a capsule in the middle of the screen if you're lucky because it's falling down. Fast! üöÄ

{% include _alert.html type:'success' title: "You learnt how to add a 3D capsule to the scene and how to add it to the root scene so it becomes part of the scene graph. The capsule is falling down because it has no collider to interact with the ground." %}

## Step 4: Control the Camera - Look Around! üñ±Ô∏è

Maybe we should at least look around the scene and view the capsule from different angles as it falls into the void üò†?

Let's add a 3D camera controller using the `Add3DCameraController()` method. üéÆ This extension adds basic camera functionality, allowing you to interact with the camera through keyboard and mouse inputs. Specifically, it attaches a regular `SyncScript` to the camera with custom logic to handle camera movement.

Your game would have your implementation how camera works which requires your specific game.

Time to refresh those mouse agility skills!

```csharp
// This was updated: Add a camera controller for basic camera movement
game.Add3DCamera().Add3DCameraController();
```

Run the application again and use right-click and hold to rotate the camera towards the capsule, or follow the instructions displayed on the screen. üé• Feeling a bit more satisfied now? Let's make the experience even more interesting! üé®‚ú®

{% include _alert.html type:'success' title: "You learnt how to add a 3D camera controller to the scene to allow basic camera movement. You can now rotate the camera using the mouse and keyboard." %}

## Step 5: Reposition the Capsule - More Excitement! üìç

Let's reposition the capsule to add a bit more excitement and give us a few extra seconds to admire it before it falls. Update the `Start` method as shown below, and don't forget to add the `Stride.Core.Mathematics` namespace for handling the 3D positioning.

```csharp
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Engine;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Rendering.ProceduralModels;
using Stride.Core.Mathematics;  // This was added: Import Vector3 and other math utilities
using Stride.Engine;

// Create an instance of the game
using var game = new Game();

// Start the game loop and provide the Start method as a callback
game.Run(start: Start);

// Define the Start method to set up the scene
void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    // Add the default graphics compositor to handle rendering
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();

    // Add a 3D camera and a controller for basic camera movement
    game.Add3DCamera().Add3DCameraController();

    // Create a 3D primitive capsule and store it in an entity
    var entity = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Capsule);

    // Reposition the capsule 8 units above the origin in the scene
    entity.Transform.Position = new Vector3(0, 8, 0); // This was added

    // Add the entity to the root scene so it becomes part of the scene graph
    entity.Scene = rootScene;
}
```
- `entity.Transform.Position` sets the position of the entity within the scene. The `Vector3` object represents a 3D vector, which in this case, places the capsule at coordinates `(0, 8, 0)`, which is 8 units above the scene's origin.
- `Stride.Core.Mathematics` Stride uses its own implementation of `Vector3` and other math utilities, so we need to add this namespace to access those features.

Run the application again. You should see a capsule falling down from the top of the screen. I know, the capsule is black, but don't worry, we'll fix that later. üòâ

{% include _alert.html type:'success' title: "You learnt how to reposition the capsule in the scene using the <code>Transform</code> component's <code>Position</code> property. The capsule is now 8 units above the origin, giving you a better view as it falls." %}

## Step 6: Add a Ground - Catch the Capsule! üõë

Now let's catch the capsule by adding some ground to the scene. Update the `Start` method to look like this:

```csharp
// Define the Start method to set up the scene
void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    // Add the default graphics compositor to handle rendering
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();

    // Add a 3D camera and a controller for basic camera movement
    game.Add3DCamera().Add3DCameraController();

    // Add a 3D ground plane to catch the capsule
    game.Add3DGround(); // This was added

    // Create a 3D primitive capsule and store it in an entity
    var entity = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Capsule);

    // Reposition the capsule 8 units above the origin in the scene
    entity.Transform.Position = new Vector3(0, 8, 0);

    // Add the entity to the root scene so it becomes part of the scene graph
    entity.Scene = rootScene;
}
```

- `Add3DGround()` is a toolkit helper method that creates a 3D ground plane in the scene, providing a surface for the capsule to land on.

Run the application again. You should see the capsule falling down and landing on the ground. üéâ Unfortunately, it's still a black capsule on a black ground ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. But don't worry, we‚Äôll fix that later! In the meantime, you can move the camera around using the mouse and keyboard (Q or E) to lower or raise the camera and watch the capsule roll around on the ground. üñ±Ô∏è‚å®Ô∏è

{% include _alert.html type:'success' title: "You learnt how to add a 3D ground plane to the scene, providing a surface for the capsule to land on. The capsule now falls and lands on the ground, creating a more dynamic scene." %}

## Step 7: Illuminate the Scene - Add Light! üí°

It's time to brighten things up! Adding some light to the scene will help us see our objects more clearly. Thankfully, there's a helper method called `game.AddDirectionalLight()` that adds a directional light to the scene. Update the `Start` method to look like this:

```csharp
// Define the Start method to set up the scene
void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    // Add the default graphics compositor to handle rendering
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();

    // Add a 3D camera and a controller for basic camera movement
    game.Add3DCamera().Add3DCameraController();

    // Add a directional light to illuminate the scene
    game.AddDirectionalLight(); // This was added

    // Add a 3D ground plane to catch the capsule
    game.Add3DGround();

    // Create a 3D primitive capsule and store it in an entity
    var entity = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Capsule);

    // Reposition the capsule 8 units above the origin in the scene
    entity.Transform.Position = new Vector3(0, 8, 0);

    // Add the entity to the root scene so it becomes part of the scene graph
    entity.Scene = rootScene;
}
```

Run the application again. üåü You should now see the capsule falling down and landing on the ground, with everything clearly illuminated by the directional light. The capsule and ground are much easier to see, thanks to the added light shining on the scene. üéâ

Finally, no more black-on-black mysteries! üí°

{% include _alert.html type:'success' title: "You learnt how to add a directional light to the scene, illuminating the capsule and ground. The scene is now well-lit, making it easier to see and interact with the objects." %}

## Step 8: Break 1 - Let's Reflect üòÖ

Tedious work but great job, explorer! üéâ You‚Äôve just learned the very basics of game setup behind the scenes‚Äîwork that‚Äôs usually done for you automatically in the Game Studio. Let‚Äôs take a moment to reflect on what we've built so far:

- You need a [Graphics Compositor](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/graphics/graphics-compositor/index.html) to render the scene.
- You need a [Camera](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/graphics/cameras/index.html) to view the scene from different angles.
- You need a Camera Controller, a [C# script](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/scripts/index.html), to move the camera around and navigate the scene.
- You need a [Light](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/graphics/lights-and-shadows/index.html) to illuminate the scene and bring everything into focus

Once these basics are set up, you can start adding entities to the scene. In our example, we‚Äôve added:

- A 3D Ground, a simple primitive model that provides a surface.
- A Capsule, another primitive model, which we‚Äôve repositioned and dropped into the scene.

The toolkit automatically added [colliders](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/physics/colliders.html) for the ground and capsule, ensuring that the capsule doesn't fall through the ground but instead interacts realistically with the scene.

{%- capture title -%}
You can check the implementation of each [Stride toolkit extension](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-community-toolkit/tree/main/src/Stride.CommunityToolkit), which wraps some boilerplate code, and create your own custom implementation.
{%- endcapture -%}
{% include _alert.html type:'info' title:title %}

Whew! üòÖ Take a deep breath, and get ready for the next part of our journey. Up next: performance optimizations and more interactive elements. üöÄ

## Step 9: Add Profiler - Performance! üìà

As game developers, we love seeing those sweet FPS numbers! üéÆ The toolkit provides a `game.AddProfiler()` method that adds a performance profiler to the game, allowing us to monitor important metrics like frames per second (FPS).

Update the `Start` method to look like this:

```csharp
// Define the Start method to set up the scene
void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    // Add the default graphics compositor to handle rendering
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();

    // Add a 3D camera and a controller for basic camera movement
    game.Add3DCamera().Add3DCameraController();

    // Add a directional light to illuminate the scene
    game.AddDirectionalLight();

    // Add a 3D ground plane to catch the capsule
    game.Add3DGround();

    // Add a performance profiler to monitor FPS and other metrics
    game.AddProfiler(); // This was added

    // Create a 3D primitive capsule and store it in an entity
    var entity = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Capsule);

    // Reposition the capsule 8 units above the origin in the scene
    entity.Transform.Position = new Vector3(0, 8, 0);

    // Add the entity to the root scene so it becomes part of the scene graph
    entity.Scene = rootScene;
}
```

Run the application again. You should see [profiler text output](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/troubleshooting/profiling.html) in the top-left corner of the screen, showing the frames per second (FPS) and other performance metrics. üöÄ Press F1 to cycle through different profiler outputs and monitor various aspects of your game's performance. üìä

{% include _alert.html type:'success' title: "You learnt how to add a performance profiler to the scene, allowing you to monitor FPS and other metrics. The profiler provides valuable insights into the game's performance and helps identify areas for optimization." %}

## Step 10: Illuminate the Scene - Add Skybox! üåá

As exciting as things are looking, we can make our scene even better by adding a [skybox](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/graphics/textures/skyboxes-and-backgrounds.html). A skybox will enhance the overall atmosphere and give our scene a more polished, realistic look. üåá

The toolkit provides a `AddSkybox()` method that adds a skybox to the scene. First, we need to add another NuGet package, `Stride.CommunityToolkit.Skyboxes`, which includes assets required for the skybox.

```bash
dotnet add package Stride.CommunityToolkit.Skyboxes --prerelease
```

Then, update the code to look like this:


```csharp
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Engine;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Rendering.ProceduralModels;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Skyboxes;  // This was added: Import skybox helpers
using Stride.Core.Mathematics;
using Stride.Engine;

// Create an instance of the game
using var game = new Game();

// Start the game loop and provide the Start method as a callback
game.Run(start: Start);

// Define the Start method to set up the scene
void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    // Add the default graphics compositor to handle rendering
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();

    // Add a 3D camera and a controller for basic camera movement
    game.Add3DCamera().Add3DCameraController();

    // Add a directional light to illuminate the scene
    game.AddDirectionalLight();

    // Add a 3D ground plane to catch the capsule
    game.Add3DGround();

    // Add a performance profiler to monitor FPS and other metrics
    game.AddProfiler();

    // Add a skybox to enhance the scene's visuals
    game.AddSkybox(); // This was added

    // Create a 3D primitive capsule and store it in an entity
    var entity = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Capsule);

    // Reposition the capsule 8 units above the origin in the scene
    entity.Transform.Position = new Vector3(0, 8, 0);

    // Add the entity to the root scene so it becomes part of the scene graph
    entity.Scene = rootScene;
}
```

Run the application again. üéÆ You should now see a beautiful skybox surrounding the scene, making it look more immersive and realistic. üåÖ The [skybox](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/graphics/textures/skyboxes-and-backgrounds.html) is essentially a large, textured 3D model that wraps around the entire scene, providing a visually appealing background. üåá

{% include _alert.html type:'success' title: "You learnt how to add a skybox to the scene, enhancing the visuals and creating a more immersive environment. The skybox provides a realistic background for the scene, adding depth and atmosphere." %}

## Step 11: Add Motion - I like to Move It, Move It! üï∫

Before we dive into coding, let's take a moment to explore the different ways we can move entities in our scene. In Stride, we can move objects using two main approaches: **non-physical movement** and **physics-based movement**. Each method has its strengths and use cases, depending on the type of game or simulation you're creating.

### Moving Entities by Changing Their Position Directly (Without Colliders)

This method involves directly modifying an entity's position in the scene by changing its `Transform.Position`. It's a straightforward approach that allows you to move objects freely without considering the physics of the environment. Here are some key points to keep in mind:

- **Simple Movement:** This method is ideal for scenarios where you want to move objects in a controlled manner without requiring interaction with other entities.
- **Non-Physical:** The entity doesn't respond to gravity, collisions, or any external forces. This makes it perfect for UI elements, floating objects, or objects that need to follow a predefined path.
- **No Interaction:** By default, the entity won't collide with or interact with other objects in the scene. This can simplify certain game mechanics but also limits realism.

Use cases for non-physical movement include:

- **Camera Movement:** Moving a camera smoothly around the scene without it being affected by the environment.
- **UI Elements:** Moving user interface elements, like menus or health bars, without considering collisions.

### Moving Entities Using Physics (With Colliders)

This approach leverages [Stride's physics engine](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/manual/physics/index.html) to handle movement. By applying forces and impulses to an entity's `RigidbodyComponent`, we can create realistic interactions that respond to gravity, collisions, and other physical phenomena. Key aspects of this approach include:

- **Realistic Movement:** Entities move according to the laws of physics, making this method suitable for objects that need to interact with the environment.
- **Collisions:** The entity will collide with other objects, allowing for dynamic interactions, such as objects bouncing off surfaces or pushing each other.
- **Forces:** Movement can be influenced by various forces, including gravity, wind, or explosions. This allows for more complex and dynamic gameplay mechanics.
- **Physics-Driven Gameplay:** This method is ideal for games that rely on physics-based mechanics, such as puzzle games, platformers, or simulations.

Use cases for physics-based movement include:

- **Dynamic Objects:** Moving objects that need to interact with other entities, like bouncing balls or rolling barrels.
- **Character Movement:** Characters or vehicles that need to respond to the environment realistically.
- **Environmental Interaction:** Objects that react to player actions, such as crates that can be pushed or destroyed.

## Step 12: Add Motion without Physics - Move the Cube without Colliders! üì¶ 

Let's add a a cube to the scene! üéâ
     
We'll start with the first option: moving the cube by directly changing its position. Update the code to look like this:


```csharp
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Engine;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Rendering.ProceduralModels;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Skyboxes;
using Stride.Core.Mathematics;
using Stride.Engine;
using Stride.Games;  // This was added

float movementSpeed = 1f; // This was added
Entity? cube1 = null; // This was added

// Create an instance of the game
using var game = new Game();

// Start the game loop and provide the Start and Update methods as callbacks
game.Run(start: Start, update: Update); // This was updated

// Define the Start method to set up the scene
void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    // Add the default graphics compositor to handle rendering
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();

    // Add a 3D camera and a controller for basic camera movement
    game.Add3DCamera().Add3DCameraController();

    // Add a directional light to illuminate the scene
    game.AddDirectionalLight();

    // Add a 3D ground plane to catch the capsule
    game.Add3DGround();

    // Add a performance profiler to monitor FPS and other metrics
    game.AddProfiler();

    // Add a skybox to enhance the scene's visuals
    game.AddSkybox();

    // Add a ground gizmo to visualize axis directions
    game.AddGroundGizmo(position: new Vector3(-5, 0.1f, -5), showAxisName: true);

    // Create a 3D primitive capsule and store it in an entity
    var entity = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Capsule);

    // Reposition the capsule 8 units above the origin in the scene
    entity.Transform.Position = new Vector3(0, 8, 0);

    // Add the entity to the root scene so it becomes part of the scene graph
    entity.Scene = rootScene;

    // This was added
    // Create a cube with material, disable its collider, and add it to the scene
    // The cube is hanging in the default position Vector(0,0,0) in the air,
    cube1 = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Cube, new()
    {
        Material = game.CreateMaterial(Color.Gold),
        IncludeCollider = false // No collider for non-physical movement
    });
    cube1.Scene = rootScene;
}

// This was added
// Define the Update method, called every frame to update the game state
void Update(Scene scene, GameTime time)
{
    // Calculate the time elapsed since the last frame for consistent movement
    // This is crucial for frame-independent movement, ensuring consistent
    // behaviour regardless of frame rate.
    var deltaTime = (float)time.Elapsed.TotalSeconds;

    if (cube1 != null)
    {
         // Move the cube along the negative X-axis with frame-independent motion
        cube1.Transform.Position -= new Vector3(movementSpeed * deltaTime, 0, 0);
    }
}

```

- `movementSpeed` determines how fast the cube moves.
- `cube1` is an `Entity` object representing the cube in the scene.
- `AddGroundGizmo()` adds a visual representation of the ground plane and axis directions.
- `CreateMaterial()` allows you to color the cube (and even the capsule if you want üòâ).
- `Update()` is a callback method that is called every frame to update the game state.

Run the application. üèÉ You should see a box (cube) moving along the X-axis, without interacting with other entities.

{% include _alert.html type:'success' title: "You learnt how to move a cube without colliders using non-physical movement. The cube moves smoothly along the X-axis, demonstrating basic animation and object manipulation." %}

## Step 13: Add Motion with Physics - Move the Cube with Colliders! üßä

Now that we've moved the cube without colliders, let's dive into the more realistic option: moving the cube using physics. With this approach, the cube will interact with the environment, responding to forces like gravity and colliding with other entities.

Update the code to include physics-based movement:


```csharp
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Engine;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Rendering.ProceduralModels;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Skyboxes;
using Stride.Core.Mathematics;
using Stride.Engine;
using Stride.Games;
using Stride.Physics; // This was added

float movementSpeed = 1f;
float force = 3f; // This was added
Entity? cube1 = null;
Entity? cube2 = null; // This was added

// Create an instance of the game
using var game = new Game();

// Start the game loop and provide the Start and Update methods as callbacks
game.Run(start: Start, update: Update);

// Define the Start method to set up the scene
void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    // Add the default graphics compositor to handle rendering
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();

    // Add a 3D camera and a controller for basic camera movement
    game.Add3DCamera().Add3DCameraController();

    // Add a directional light to illuminate the scene
    game.AddDirectionalLight();

    // Add a 3D ground plane to catch the capsule
    game.Add3DGround();

    // Add a performance profiler to monitor FPS and other metrics
    game.AddProfiler();

    // Add a skybox to enhance the scene's visuals
    game.AddSkybox();

    // Add a ground gizmo to visualize axis directions
    game.AddGroundGizmo(position: new Vector3(-5, 0.1f, -5), showAxisName: true);

    // Create a 3D primitive capsule and store it in an entity
    var entity = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Capsule);

    // Reposition the capsule 8 units above the origin in the scene
    entity.Transform.Position = new Vector3(0, 8, 0);

    // Add the entity to the root scene so it becomes part of the scene graph
    entity.Scene = rootScene;

    // Create a cube without a collider and add it to the scene (non-physical movement)
    cube1 = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Cube, new()
    {
        Material = game.CreateMaterial(Color.Gold),
        IncludeCollider = false // No collider for simple movement
    });
    cube1.Scene = rootScene;

    // This was added
    // Create a second cube with a collider for physics-based interaction
    cube2 = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Cube, new()
    {
        Material = game.CreateMaterial(Color.Orange)
    });
    cube2.Transform.Position = new Vector3(-3, 5, 0);  // Reposition the cube above the ground
    cube2.Scene = rootScene;
}

// Define the Update method, called every frame to update the game state
void Update(Scene scene, GameTime time)
{
    // Calculate the time elapsed since the last frame for consistent movement
    var deltaTime = (float)time.Elapsed.TotalSeconds;

    if (cube1 != null)
    {
        // Move the first cube along the negative X-axis (non-physical movement)
        cube1.Transform.Position -= new Vector3(movementSpeed * deltaTime, 0, 0);
    }

    // This was added
    // Handle physics-based movement for cube2
    if (cube2 != null)
    {
        // Retrieve the RigidbodyComponent, which handles physics interactions
        var rigidBody = cube2.Get<RigidbodyComponent>();

        // Check if cube2 is stationary by verifying if its linear velocity is effectively zero.
        if (Math.Round(rigidBody.LinearVelocity.Length()) == 0)
        {
            // Apply an impulse to cube2 along the X-axis, initiating movement.
            rigidBody.ApplyImpulse(new Vector3(force, 0, 0));

            // Reverse the direction of the impulse for the next impulse,
            // allowing cube2 to move back and forth along the X-axis.
            force *= -1;
        }
    }
}

```

Key Concepts:

- `RigidbodyComponent`: This component handles physics interactions, allowing the entity to respond to forces, gravity, and collisions.
- `ApplyImpulse()`: This method applies a force to the entity, causing it to move in the direction of the applied force. In this case, we‚Äôre applying an impulse to the cube, making it move along the X-axis.
- `LinearVelocity`: This property represents the velocity of the cube. We check if the velocity is near zero (indicating the cube is stationary) before applying the impulse.

Run the application. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è You should now see two cubes in the scene:

- **Cube 1** moves along the X-axis using non-physical movement, just like in the previous step.
- **Cube 2** interacts with the environment using physics, responding to forces and collisions.

This step introduces a new level of realism by making the cube react to physical forces, adding depth and complexity to your game. üéÆ

The main difference between the two cubes is that **Cube 1** moves without interacting with the environment. We directly modify the entity's `Transform.Position` to move it, resulting in simple, non-physical movement. In contrast, **Cube 2** responds to physics, collisions, and forces. Instead of manually changing its position, we control its movement through the `RigidbodyComponent`, which handles all the physics-based interactions, including gravity, impulses, and collisions with other objects in the scene. This makes Cube 2's movement more realistic and reactive to its surroundings.

{% include _alert.html type:'success' title: "You learnt how to move a cube using physics-based movement, allowing it to interact with the environment. The cube responds to forces, gravity, and collisions, creating a more dynamic and realistic scene." %}

## Step 14: Add Keyboard Interaction - Move the Cube! ‚å®Ô∏è

Now it's time to add some interactivity! üéÆ We will update the `Update` method to allow the player to move the cubes around using the keyboard. We'll make sure both **Cube 1** (non-physical movement) and **Cube 2** (physics-based movement) respond to key presses.

Ensure that the `using Stride.Input;` namespace is included to handle input.

You can replace the existing `Update` method with the following code:

```csharp
// Define the Update method, called every frame to update the game state
void Update(Scene scene, GameTime time)
{
    // Calculate the time elapsed since the last frame for consistent movement
    var deltaTime = (float)time.Elapsed.TotalSeconds;

    // This was updated
    // Handle non-physical movement for cube1
    if (cube1 != null)
    {
        // Move the first cube along the negative X-axis when the Z key is held down
        if (game.Input.IsKeyDown(Keys.Z))
        {
            cube1.Transform.Position -= new Vector3(movementSpeed * deltaTime, 0, 0);
        }
        // Move the first cube along the positive X-axis when the X key is held down
        else if (game.Input.IsKeyDown(Keys.X))
        {
            // Move the first cube along the positive X-axis (non-physical movement)
            cube1.Transform.Position += new Vector3(movementSpeed * deltaTime, 0, 0);
        }
    }

    // This was updated
    // Handle physics-based movement for cube2
    if (cube2 != null)
    {
        // Retrieve the RigidbodyComponent, which handles physics interactions
        var rigidBody = cube2.Get<RigidbodyComponent>();

        // We use KeyPressed instead of KeyDown to apply impulses only once per key press
        // Apply an impulse to the left when the C key is pressed
        if (game.Input.IsKeyPressed(Keys.C))
        {
            rigidBody.ApplyImpulse(new Vector3(-force, 0, 0));
        }
        // Apply an impulse to the right when the V key is pressed
        else if (game.Input.IsKeyPressed(Keys.V))
        {
            rigidBody.ApplyImpulse(new Vector3(force, 0, 0));
        }
    }
}
```

- `game.Input.IsKeyDown()` checks if a key is currently held down. This is useful for continuous movement while a key is pressed.
- `game.Input.IsKeyPressed()` checks if a key was pressed once. This is ideal for actions that should only trigger once per key press, like applying an impulse to a physics object.

**Additional Points:**

- The non-physical movement for **Cube 1** allows smooth, continuous movement along the X-axis when holding the Z or X keys.
- The physics-based movement for **Cube 2** applies an impulse to the cube when the C or V keys are pressed, allowing it to interact with the environment.
- The capsule does not collide with **Cube 1** because we disabled the collider for that cube but interacts with **Cube 2**, which has a collider and responds to physics.
 
Run the application. You should now be able to control **Cube 1**'s position with the Z and X keys, moving it left and right, and apply impulses to **Cube 2** with the C and V keys, pushing it back and forth and colliding with the capsule. üéÆ

This step introduces basic keyboard controls, adding interactivity to your scene and allowing the player to manipulate objects in real-time. Ready to add even more interaction? Let's move on to mouse controls next! üñ±Ô∏è

{% include _alert.html type:'success' title: "You learnt how to add keyboard interaction to the scene, allowing players to move the cubes using the Z, X, C, and V keys. The cubes respond to key presses, enabling dynamic movement and interaction within the scene." %}

## Step 15: Add Mouse Interaction - Do something! üñ±Ô∏è

Let's add mouse interaction to the scene! üê≠ In this step, we'll update the `Update` method to allow players to interact with the cubes and the capsule using the mouse üñ±Ô∏è. We'll make sure both **Cube 1** (non-physical movement), **Cube 2**, and the capsule (physics-based movement) respond to mouse input.

The previous comments have been streamlined to keep the code clean and focused. üßπ

You can replace the whole code with the following:

```csharp
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Engine;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Rendering.ProceduralModels;
using Stride.CommunityToolkit.Skyboxes;
using Stride.Core.Mathematics;
using Stride.Engine;
using Stride.Games;

float movementSpeed = 1f;
float force = 3f;

using var game = new Game();

game.Run(start: Start, update: Update);

void Start(Scene rootScene)
{
    game.AddGraphicsCompositor();
    game.Add3DCamera().Add3DCameraController();
    game.AddDirectionalLight();
    game.Add3DGround();
    game.AddProfiler();
    game.AddSkybox();
    game.AddGroundGizmo(position: new Vector3(-5, 0.1f, -5), showAxisName: true);

    var entity = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Capsule);
    entity.Transform.Position = new Vector3(0, 8, 0);
    entity.Scene = rootScene;

    cube1 = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Cube, new()
    {
        Material = game.CreateMaterial(Color.Gold),
        IncludeCollider = false // No collider for simple movement
    });
    cube1.Scene = rootScene;

    cube2 = game.Create3DPrimitive(PrimitiveModelType.Cube, new()
    {
        Material = game.CreateMaterial(Color.Orange)
    });
    cube2.Transform.Position = new Vector3(-3, 5, 0);
    cube2.Scene = rootScene;

    // These were added
    // Initialize camera, simulation, and model component for interactions
    camera = rootScene.GetCamera();
    simulation = game.SceneSystem.SceneInstance.GetProcessor<PhysicsProcessor>()?.Simulation;
    cube1Component = cube1.Get<ModelComponent>();
}

void Update(Scene scene, GameTime time)
{
    var deltaTime = (float)time.Elapsed.TotalSeconds;

    // Handle non-physical movement for cube1
    if (cube1 != null)
    {
        if (game.Input.IsKeyDown(Keys.Z))
        {
            cube1.Transform.Position -= new Vector3(movementSpeed * deltaTime, 0, 0);
        }
        else if (game.Input.IsKeyDown(Keys.X))
        {
            cube1.Transform.Position += new Vector3(movementSpeed * deltaTime, 0, 0);
        }
    }

    // Handle physics-based movement for cube2
    if (cube2 != null)
    {
        var rigidBody = cube2.Get<RigidbodyComponent>();

        if (game.Input.IsKeyPressed(Keys.C))
        {
            rigidBody.ApplyImpulse(new Vector3(-force, 0, 0));
        }
        else if (game.Input.IsKeyPressed(Keys.V))
        {
            rigidBody.ApplyImpulse(new Vector3(force, 0, 0));
        }
    }

    // This was added
    // Ensure camera and simulation are initialized before handling mouse input
    if (camera == null || simulation == null) return;

    // This was added
    // Handle mouse input for interactions
    if (game.Input.HasMouse && game.Input.IsMouseButtonPressed(MouseButton.Left))
    {
        // Check for collisions with physics-based entities using raycasting
        var hitResult = camera.RaycastMouse(simulation, game.Input.MousePosition);

        if (hitResult.Succeeded)
        {
            var message = $"Hit: {hitResult.Collider.Entity.Name}";
            Console.WriteLine(message);

            var rigidBody = hitResult.Collider.Entity.Get<RigidbodyComponent>();

            if (rigidBody != null)
            {
                var direction = new Vector3(0, 3, 0); // Apply impulse upward

                rigidBody.ApplyImpulse(direction);
            }
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("No hit detected.");
        }

        // Check for intersections with non-physical entities using ray picking
        var ray = camera.GetPickRay(game.Input.MousePosition);

        if (cube1Component?.BoundingBox.Intersects(ref ray) ?? false)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Cube 1 hit!");
        }
    }
}
```
- **Mouse Interaction**: We've added functionality to detect mouse clicks and interact with both physics-based and non-physical entities.
- **Camera** and **Simulation**: The `camera` component and `simulation` are initialized for handling raycasting and physics interactions.
- **Raycasting** and **Ray Picking**: We use `camera.RaycastMouse()` to detect collisions with physics-based entities and `camera.GetPickRay()` to check for intersections with non-physical entities like **Cube 1**.

Now, when you click the left mouse button, the application will respond with the following actions depending on where you click:

- **Clicking Outside the Ground:** If you click anywhere in the scene that doesn't interact with an object or the ground, it will print "No hit detected." This indicates that the mouse ray didn't intersect with any entities.
- **Clicking on Cube 1:** Since **Cube 1** doesn't have a collider, two things will happen:
    - The raycast will pass through **Cube 1** and hit the ground beneath it, printing "Hit: Ground."
    - Additionally, the ray-picking method will detect that **Cube 1** was hit, and it will print "Cube 1 hit!"
- **Clicking on Cube 2:** **Cube 2** has a collider, so the raycast will detect the collision and print "Hit: Entity" An impulse will be applied to **Cube 2**, making it move upward in response to the click.
- **Clicking on the Capsule:** Similar to **Cube 2**, clicking on the capsule will print "Hit: Entity", and an upward impulse will be applied to the capsule, causing it to move.
- **Clicking on the Ground:** If you click directly on the ground, the raycast will detect it and print "Hit: Ground." However, the ground won't move because it has a `StaticColliderComponent`, which means it's a fixed object in the scene.

Nice job! You‚Äôve now implemented mouse interaction, which adds a whole new level of interactivity to the game. üöÄ You can now click on objects in the scene to trigger different actions, like moving cubes or capsules with physics or detecting hits on non-physical entities. This opens up endless possibilities for gameplay mechanics! üéÆ We rock! ü§ò

{% include _alert.html type:'success' title: "You learnt how to add mouse interaction to the scene, allowing players to interact with objects using raycasting and ray picking. The application responds to mouse clicks by applying impulses to physics-based entities and detecting hits on non-physical entities." %}

## Step 16: Add Output - Console or Screen! üì∫

In this part we will do just basic output to the console and the screen. You have already added a simple text output `Console.WriteLine()` to the screen to display the interaction of the entity that was hit by the mouse raycast. This will help us visualize the interactions and provide feedback to the player.

We have a few options where the output can be displayed:

- **Console Output:** We can print messages to the console window, which is useful for debugging and logging information. This option is great for developers to see real-time feedback and debug the game.
  - We can use traditional `Console.WriteLine()`.
  - We can use Stride's `GlobalLogger.GetLogger()` respectively `Log` property if used in from the script.
- **Debug Text Output:** We can display text directly in the game window.
- **UI Elements:** We can create UI elements like text labels, buttons, or images to display information to the player.

Let's update the `if (hitResult.Succeeded) {}` block of code like this:

```csharp
if (hitResult.Succeeded)
{
    var message = $"Hit: {hitResult.Collider.Entity.Name}";
    Console.WriteLine(message);
    GlobalLogger.GetLogger("Program.cs").Info(message); // This was added
    game.DebugTextSystem.Print("Some text", new Int2(50, 50)); // This was added

    var rigidBody = hitResult.Collider.Entity.Get<RigidbodyComponent>();

    if (rigidBody != null)
    {
        var direction = new Vector3(0, 3, 0); // Apply impulse upward

        rigidBody.ApplyImpulse(direction);
    }
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("No hit detected.");
}

```
Run the application. You should see now in the console window an additional output in the green text of the entity interaction when you click on the entities, however not on the screen. Or you might see just a quick flash of the text on the screen because it is rewritten every frame.

Let's move the output to the screen `game.DebugTextSystem.Print()` at the beginning of the `Update()` method. The `Update()` method should look like this:

```csharp
void Update(Scene scene, GameTime time)
{
    game.DebugTextSystem.Print("Some text", new Int2(50, 50)); // This was moved

    var deltaTime = (float)time.Elapsed.TotalSeconds;

    // Handle non-physical movement for cube1
    if (cube1 != null)
    {
        if (game.Input.IsKeyDown(Keys.Z))
        {
            cube1.Transform.Position -= new Vector3(movementSpeed * deltaTime, 0, 0);
        }
        else if (game.Input.IsKeyDown(Keys.X))
        {
            cube1.Transform.Position += new Vector3(movementSpeed * deltaTime, 0, 0);
        }
    }

    // Handle physics-based movement for cube2
    if (cube2 != null)
    {
        var rigidBody = cube2.Get<RigidbodyComponent>();

        if (game.Input.IsKeyPressed(Keys.C))
        {
            rigidBody.ApplyImpulse(new Vector3(-force, 0, 0));
        }
        else if (game.Input.IsKeyPressed(Keys.V))
        {
            rigidBody.ApplyImpulse(new Vector3(force, 0, 0));
        }
    }

    if (camera == null || simulation == null) return;

    if (game.Input.HasMouse && game.Input.IsMouseButtonPressed(MouseButton.Left))
    {
        // Check for collisions with physics-based entities using raycasting
        var hitResult = camera.RaycastMouse(simulation, game.Input.MousePosition);

        if (hitResult.Succeeded)
        {
            var message = $"Hit: {hitResult.Collider.Entity.Name}";
            Console.WriteLine(message);
            GlobalLogger.GetLogger("Program.cs").Info(message);

            var rigidBody = hitResult.Collider.Entity.Get<RigidbodyComponent>();

            if (rigidBody != null)
            {
                var direction = new Vector3(0, 3, 0); // Apply impulse upward

                rigidBody.ApplyImpulse(direction);
            }
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("No hit detected.");
        }

        // Check for intersections with non-physical entities using ray picking
        var ray = camera.GetPickRay(game.Input.MousePosition);

        if (cube1Component?.BoundingBox.Intersects(ref ray) ?? false)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Cube 1 hit!");

Save and run the application. You should now see the text **"Some text"** displayed on the screen at the position (50, 50). Nice, we have some output on the screen! üì∫

## Step 17: Break 2 - Let's Reflect üòÖ

Congratulations, explorer! üéâ You've made it through another set of challenges and learned how to add mouse interaction to your scene. By implementing raycasting and ray picking, you've enabled players to interact with objects in the scene, triggering various actions based on their clicks. üñ±Ô∏è

Let's take a moment to reflect on what we've accomplished so far:

- **Non-Physical Movement:** You learned how to move objects without physics by directly changing their positions. This method is ideal for simple, controlled movement and UI elements that don't require interactions with the environment.
- **Physics-Based Movement:** You explored how to move objects using physics, allowing them to respond to forces, gravity, and collisions. This method is perfect for creating realistic interactions and dynamic gameplay mechanics.
- **Keyboard Interaction:** You added keyboard controls to move cubes left and right and apply impulses to physics-based objects. This introduced basic interactivity to the scene, allowing players to control objects using key presses.
- **Mouse Interaction:** You implemented mouse input to interact with objects in the scene. By using raycasting and ray picking, you enabled players to click on entities, trigger actions, and receive feedback based on their interactions.
- **Output to Console and Screen:** You added text output to the screen to display the name of the entity hit by the mouse raycast. This visual feedback helps players understand the interactions and provides context for their actions.
- **Game Loop:** You learned how the game loop works, updating the game state every frame and handling player input to create dynamic and responsive gameplay.
- **Performance Monitoring:** You explored the importance of monitoring performance metrics, such as frames per second (FPS), to optimize your game and ensure a smooth player experience.
- **Scene Setup:** You set up the scene with essential components like cameras, lights, and ground planes, creating a foundation for building interactive and visually appealing environments.
