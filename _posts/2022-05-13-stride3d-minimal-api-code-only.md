I love the concept of .NET 6 minimal API (thanks @davidfowl and @aspnet!), with a bit of help from the @stridedotnet community, we are also experimenting. 12 lines of code. Coming soon with Stride 4.1 release. 

```csharp
public class EFConfigurationValue
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Value { get; set; }
}
```
